  TRADE DURATION ANALYSIS
  Michele Piazzoli — Data Analysis
================================================================================

  This report analyzes how long trades stay open, measured
  in minutes from entry to exit.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ALL TRADES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Count:                    948 trades

  Mean (average duration):  169.0 minutes
    The arithmetic average of all trade durations.

  Median (middle value):    30.0 minutes
    Half of all trades lasted less than this, half lasted
    more. Not affected by outliers like very long trades.

  Standard Deviation:       555.3 minutes
    Measures how spread out the durations are. A high value
    means trade durations vary a lot from trade to trade.

  Minimum Duration:         5.0 minutes
    The shortest trade in this category.

  Maximum Duration:         4455.0 minutes
    The longest trade in this category.

  Skewness:                 5.1095
    Measures asymmetry. Positive skew means most trades
    are short but a few last much longer (right tail).
    Negative skew would mean the opposite.

  Percentiles (what percentage of trades are below this duration):
    10th percentile:  5.0 minutes
    25th percentile:  15.0 minutes
    50th percentile:  30.0 minutes  (same as the median)
    75th percentile:  75.0 minutes
    90th percentile:  211.5 minutes
    95th percentile:  626.0 minutes
    99th percentile:  3134.1 minutes
